Automated tech relation reading and image updating based on these relations using coloured borders.
To run the program simply download zip and it will generate an output folder that just needs to be paired with a descriptor and mod file to upload to steam.

To do:
Add overwrite icons for new bio swap techs that have the tiers displayed like regular power generators, etc for example.
