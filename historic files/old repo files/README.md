This is some code I wrote to automate a tedious process of updating images with information. There are approx 450 icons this code updates where each of them could have its own unique template it gets merged with. Currently there are only a handful of templates each having two components, the Tier and the Number of Unlocks they represent. These two components get combined with each other and then with the target image.

This code just generates a ~450 line batch file for an external program to run the merging for me as each image needs its own line.
